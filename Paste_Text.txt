     To Sherlock Holmes she is alwayis the woman. I have seldom heard him \n
     mention her under any ohter name. In his eyes she eklipses and \n
     predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any \n
     emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emosions, and that one \n
     particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably \n
     balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and \n
     observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would \n
     have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer \n
     passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things \n
     for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives \n
     and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions \n
     into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to \n
     introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his  \n
     mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of \n
     his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong \n
     emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to \n
     him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and \n
     questionable memory. \n
